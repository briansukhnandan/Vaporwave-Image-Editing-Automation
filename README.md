This program is used to automate the image editing process for creating a Vaporwave image. These images are usually vibrant, and usually feature a retro-themed image for the aesthetic it imposes.
The process for creating these images are generally the same, so I thought I'd automate the process.

# What I learned #
- The basics of Image-editing automation.
- How Pictures and Pixel values are stored in memory and how to manipulate them.
- A good introduction to Image Processing Programming
